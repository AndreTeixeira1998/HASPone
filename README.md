# HA SwitchPlate HASPone

The HA SwitchPlate is a DIY user-programmable LCD touchscreen you can mount into a [standard North American work box](https://www.nema.org/Standards/ComplimentaryDocuments/NEMA%20WD%206%20-%20Dimensions%20for%20Wiring%20Devices%20-%20Excerpt.pdf).  It connects to your home automation system over Wifi using [MQTT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MQTT) to display useful information and to control your smart devices.  The result is an attractive and highly-customizable controller for your home automation which you can build yourself!

## Purchase an assembled unit

As this build requires some specialist skills and tools, I will occasionally be [offering assembled devices for sale here](https://www.tindie.com/products/luma/ha-switchplate-hasp-single-wide-assembled/).

## Build your own HASPone

Check out the build guide in the HASPone wiki [here](https://github.com/HASwitchPlate/HASPone/wiki/Building-your-own-HASPone).

## Setup HASPone for Home Assistant

If you're purchased or built a HASPone, [now it's time to make it talk to Home Assistant](https://github.com/HASwitchPlate/HASPone/wiki/Configure-your-HASPone-for-Home-Assistant)

## Buy me a coffee

[![Buy me a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/assets/img/custom_images/black_img.png)](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/gW5rPpsKR)

This project is powered by coffee.  [I might get a little weird about it at times](https://github.com/aderusha/RoastLearner), but it's not much of a stretch to suggest that coffee both powers and consumes a fair portion of my mental energy.  [Hook me up if you think HASP is cool](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/gW5rPpsKR).  Thanks!
